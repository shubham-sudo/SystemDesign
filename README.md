# SystemDesign(s)

This repository is being in use for building various Low-Level System Designs. A `README.md` file is attached for most of the designs. Mostly `Python` and it's popular frameworks are used for designing & building.

## Future Goals

In future, planning to brush up few deployment tools like `DOCKER` & `Kubernetes` || `AWS`, so that environment friendly application(s) can be build and deployed easily.

## Comments

I'll be happy to get comments if someone like to pitch in, contribute, or suggest a new design (for existing ones) or system (to build new) and want to learn parallelly.
